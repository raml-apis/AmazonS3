        This header is required for HTTP 1.1 (most toolkits add this header automatically); optional for HTTP/1.0 requests.
    x-amz-security-token: 
      description: |
        This header can be used in the following scenarios:
        * Provide security tokens for Amazon DevPay operations. Each request that uses Amazon DevPay
          requires two x-amz-security-token headers: one for the product token and one for the user token.
          When Amazon S3 receives an authenticated request, it compares the computed signature with the provided signature.
          Improperly formatted multi-value headers used to calculate a signature can cause authentication issues
        * Provide security token when using temporary security credentials. When making requests using temporary security
          credentials you obtained from IAM you must provide a security token using this header.
        This header is required for requests that use Amazon DevPay and requests that are signed using temporary
        security credentials.

          Improperly formatted multi-value headers used to calculate a signature can cause authentication issues

        * Provide security tokens for Amazon DevPay operations. Each request that uses Amazon DevPay
          requires two x-amz-security-token headers: one for the product token and one for the user token.
          When Amazon S3 receives an authenticated request, it compares the computed signature with the provided signature.
          Improperly formatted multi-value headers used to calculate a signature can cause authentication issues
        * Provide security token when using temporary security credentials. When making requests using temporary security
          credentials you obtained from IAM you must provide a security token using this header.
        This header is required for requests that use Amazon DevPay and requests that are signed using temporary
        security credentials.

          requires two x-amz-security-token headers: one for the product token and one for the user token.
          When Amazon S3 receives an authenticated request, it compares the computed signature with the provided signature.
          Improperly formatted multi-value headers used to calculate a signature can cause authentication issues
        * Provide security token when using temporary security credentials. When making requests using temporary security
          credentials you obtained from IAM you must provide a security token using this header.
        This header is required for requests that use Amazon DevPay and requests that are signed using temporary
        security credentials.

            The entity tag is a hash of the object. The ETag only reflects changes to the contents of an
            object, not its metadata. The ETag is determined when an object is created.
            For objects created by the PUT Object operation and the POST Object operation, the ETag is a quoted,
            32-digit hexadecimal string representing the MD5 digest of the object data.
            For other objects, the ETag may or may not be an MD5 digest of the object data. If the ETag is not an MD5
            digest of the object data, it will contain one or more non-hexadecimal characters and/or will consis
            of less than 32 or more than 32 hexadecimal digits.

        If the message is rejected based on the headers, the body of the message is not sent.

        This header is required for HTTP 1.1 (most toolkits add this header automatically); optional for HTTP/1.0 requests.
    x-amz-security-token: 
      description: |
        This header can be used in the following scenarios:
        * Provide security tokens for Amazon DevPay operations. Each request that uses Amazon DevPay
          requires two x-amz-security-token headers: one for the product token and one for the user token.
          When Amazon S3 receives an authenticated request, it compares the computed signature with the provided signature.
          Improperly formatted multi-value headers used to calculate a signature can cause authentication issues
        * Provide security token when using temporary security credentials. When making requests using temporary security
          credentials you obtained from IAM you must provide a security token using this header.
        This header is required for requests that use Amazon DevPay and requests that are signed using temporary
        security credentials.

          requires two x-amz-security-token headers: one for the product token and one for the user token.
          When Amazon S3 receives an authenticated request, it compares the computed signature with the provided signature.
          Improperly formatted multi-value headers used to calculate a signature can cause authentication issues
        * Provide security token when using temporary security credentials. When making requests using temporary security
          credentials you obtained from IAM you must provide a security token using this header.
        This header is required for requests that use Amazon DevPay and requests that are signed using temporary
        security credentials.
